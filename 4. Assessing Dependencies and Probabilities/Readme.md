### Part VI: Dependencies and Probabilities
**Goal**: Analyze student engagement dependencies by evaluating if watching a lecture in Q2 2021 and Q2 2022 are independent events, and calculate the probability of Q2 2021 lecture engagement given Q2 2022 engagement.

#### Step I: Assessing Event Dependencies
**Objective**: Determine if watching a lecture in Q2 2021 (Event A) and Q2 2022 (Event B) are independent or dependent events.

**Steps**:
1. **Define Events**:
   - **Event A**: Student watched a lecture in Q2 2021.
   - **Event B**: Student watched a lecture in Q2 2022.

2. **Collect Data**: Extract counts of:
   - Students who watched in Q2 2021.
   - Students who watched in Q2 2022.
   - Students who watched in both periods (Q2 2021 and Q2 2022).

3. **Calculate Probabilities**:
   - \( P(A) \): Probability a student watched in Q2 2021.
   - \( P(B) \): Probability a student watched in Q2 2022.
   - \( P(A \cap B) \): Probability a student watched in both Q2 2021 and Q2 2022.

4. **Test for Independence**:
   - Check if \( P(A \cap B) \approx P(A) \times P(B) \).
   - If true, events are independent; if false, they are dependent.

#### Step II: Calculating Conditional Probability
**Objective**: Find the probability a student watched in Q2 2021, given they watched in Q2 2022.

**Steps**:
1. **Define the Task**: This is a conditional probability question: \( P(A|B) \).

2. **Identify Data for Calculation**:
   - **Numerator**: Number of students who watched in both Q2 2021 and Q2 2022.
   - **Denominator**: Total number of students who watched in Q2 2022.

3. **Calculate** \( P(A|B) \): Divide the number of students who watched in both quarters by the number of students who watched in Q2 2022.

---

**Outcome**: This analysis reveals if prior engagement in Q2 2021 impacts continued engagement in Q2 2022, providing insights into platform stickiness and user behavior.
