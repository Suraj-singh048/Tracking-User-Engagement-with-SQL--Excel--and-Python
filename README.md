# 📊 Tracking User Engagement with SQL, Excel, and Python

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze user engagement on our company’s platform, especially following several new feature releases at the end of 2021. By leveraging SQL, Excel, and Python, this project examines whether these additions—such as new courses, career tracks, and exams—have increased engagement metrics in the first half of 2022. This repository contains all relevant code, data structures, and analysis methodologies used to derive insights.

## 📈 Hypothesis
Our hypothesis is that platform improvements released in late 2021 would significantly increase user engagement and profitability in early 2022. We expect to see increased student registrations, certificates issued, and usage metrics, especially during Q2 of 2022.

## 📁 Dataset Information
The dataset has been restricted and anonymized to ensure user privacy, containing only essential information:
1. **Certificates Issued**: Student ID and issuance date for certificates in Q2 2022.
2. **Student Registrations**: Student ID and registration dates from January 1, 2020, to June 30, 2022.
3. **Purchases and Refunds**: Student ID, product type, purchase date, and refund date (if applicable) for purchases made between January 1, 2020, and June 30, 2022.
4. **Course Watching Data**: Student ID, watch time, and date of courses watched in Q2 2021 and Q2 2022.

## 🔍 Project Structure
This project is structured into eight key parts:

1. **Data Preparation with SQL – Creating a View**: Setting up an SQL view to consolidate relevant data for efficient analysis.
2. **Data Preparation with SQL – Splitting Into Periods**: Segmenting data into meaningful time periods for comparative analysis.
3. **Data Preparation with SQL – Certificates Issued**: Extracting insights from certificates issued over time.
4. **Data Preprocessing with Python – Removing Outliers**: Cleaning the dataset by removing outliers to improve analysis accuracy.
5. **Data Analysis with Excel – Hypothesis Testing**: Conducting hypothesis testing to confirm engagement trends in Q2 2022.
6. **Data Analysis with Excel – Correlation Coefficients**: Calculating correlation coefficients to understand relationships between key metrics.
7. **Dependencies and Probabilities**: Analyzing dependencies and probabilities between events using statistical methods.
8. **Data Prediction with Python**: Building predictive models to forecast future engagement based on trends observed.

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies
- **SQL**: Data extraction, transformation, and loading; creating views for data organization.
- **Python**: Data preprocessing, statistical modeling, and predictions.
- **Excel**: Hypothesis testing and correlation analysis.

## 📊 Methodology
1. **Data Preparation**: Using SQL to structure and filter data, making it analysis-ready.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Outlier detection and removal in Python to ensure data reliability.
3. **Statistical Analysis**: Conducting hypothesis tests and correlation analysis in Excel.
4. **Modeling and Prediction**: Using Python to build predictive models that forecast engagement trends.

## 💡 Key Insights
The insights gained from this project will help determine the effectiveness of recent platform updates and guide future feature releases to enhance user engagement.
